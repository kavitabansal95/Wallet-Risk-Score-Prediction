### Given your experience working with the aave V2 protocol, it's assumed that you have a clear understanding of lending protocols and on-chain transaction analysis.

In this assignment, you are provided with a list of wallet addresses. Your task is as follows:

1. **Fetch Transaction History:**
    - Retrieve the transaction data for each provided wallet address from compound V2 or V3 protocol.
2. **Data Preparation:**
    - Organize and preprocess the transaction data to create meaningful features that can reflect each wallet's risk profile.
3. **Risk Scoring:**
    - Develop a scoring model that assigns each wallet a risk score ranging from **0 to 1000**.
    - Clearly document your feature selection, normalization method, and scoring logic.
